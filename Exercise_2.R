#When run like that, R gives the following error message:
# ERROR MESSAGE:
# In RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(n, pal) :
#   n too large, allowed maximum for palette Accent is 8
# Returning the palette you asked for with that many colors
# 
# 2: Removed 11 rows containing missing values (geom_point). 
#This means that the palette chosen "Accent" only has 8 colours
#And the current dataset has 9 variables
#Consequently the last site would then be left unfilled
#This is remedied by either creating another colour palette with enough colours
#Or using one of R's colour palette's that have enough colours.
